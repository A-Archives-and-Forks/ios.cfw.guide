PwnageTool is capable of jailbreaking Pre-A5 devices on iOS 1.1.4 to 5.1.1 (though support heavily varies)

PwnageTool is an untethered jailbreak, meaning that it persists after reboot, so once it's installed you will not have to reinstall it unless you erase your device.

In order to use PwnageTool, you will need a Mac running macOS Mavericks or earlier.
