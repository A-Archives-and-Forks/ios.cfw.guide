::: warning

On A10(X) and A11 devices, you **must disable your passcode** and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you boot into a stock iOS state. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay. 

Additionally, if you are on iOS 16 and have ever set a passcode, you will need to **erase all content and settings** in order to be able to jailbreak.

On A10(X) devices, this may be able to be resolved in the future via a SEP exploit. On A11 devices, however, there isn't a SEP exploit, so this has no chance of being resolved at this time.
