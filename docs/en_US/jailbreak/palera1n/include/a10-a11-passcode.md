::: warning

On A10 and A11 devices, you **must disable your passcode** and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you remove palera1n. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay. 

On A10 devices, this may be able to be resolved in the future via a SEP exploit. On A11 devices, however, there isn't a SEP exploit, so this has no chance of being resolved at this time.
