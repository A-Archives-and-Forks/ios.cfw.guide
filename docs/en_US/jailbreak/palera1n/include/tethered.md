If you are not using the semi-tethered setting, this is a **tethered** jailbreak, which means the device must be booted using a computer every time, otherwise it won't boot at all.

However, this can be easily reverted using `irecovery -n` (and other tools that can kick the device out of recovery mode) (this will remove your jailbreak, however).
