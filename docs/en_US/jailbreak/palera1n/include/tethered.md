If you are not using the semi-tethered flag, this is a **tethered** jailbreak, which means the device must be booted using a computer every time, otherwise it won't boot at all.

However, this (and the semi-tether as well) can be easily reverted by following <router-link to="/removing-palera1n">Removing palera1n</router-link>.

If you'd like it to be semi-tethered, add the `--semi-tethered` argument to the end of the jailbreak command. Keep in mind this will use 5-10GB of storage, so this won't work on 16GB devices.
