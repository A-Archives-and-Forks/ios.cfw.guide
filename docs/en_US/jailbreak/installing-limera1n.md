limera1n is capable of jailbreaking A4 devices and the iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch 3rd Generation on iOS 4.0 to 4.1, as well as the iPad 1st Generation on 3.2.2

limera1n is an untethered jailbreak in most cases, meaning that it persists after reboot, so once it's installed you will not have to reinstall it unless you erase your device. 

::: tip

For iPad 1st Generations on 3.2.2, we recommend you use <router-link to="/installing-greenpois0n">greenpois0n</router-link> instead, as limera1n on 3.2.2 is a tethered jailbreak.

:::

::: tip

In order to use limera1n, you will need a Windows computer running Windows 8 or earlier, or macOS Mojave or earlier.
