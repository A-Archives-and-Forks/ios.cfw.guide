limera1n is capable of jailbreaking A4 devices on iOS 3.2.2 to 4.1

limera1n is an untethered jailbreak, meaning that it persists after reboot, so once it's installed you will not have to reinstall it unless you erase your device. (Note: on iOS versions other than 4.0-4.1, limera1n is a tethered jailbreak, meaning that you will be unable to reboot your device until you rejailbreak it. For this reason it's recommended that if you're on a iOS version other than 4.0-4.1, we'd recommend trying a different tool)

In order to use limera1n, you will need a Windows computer running Windows 8 or earlier, or macOS Mojave or earlier.
