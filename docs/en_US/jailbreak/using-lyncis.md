Lyncis is a webkit-based jailbreak that is capable of doing an untethered jailbreak on 32-bit iOS devices on firmware version 7.1 to 7.1.2.

::: warning

If you have just restored your device, reboot once prior to continuing, or you may run into issues.

:::

::: warning

If you are using a 64-bit device, you should follow <router-link to="/installing-pangu7">Installing pangu7</router-link> instead.

:::

## Running Lyncis

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the Lyncis website ([https://lyncisjb.com](https://lyncisjb.com))
1. Tap "Jailbreak"

::: warning

If your device crashes or restarts unexpectedly and the jailbreak isn't installed, simply try running the exploit again until it does work.

:::

You should now be jailbroken with Cydia installed on your home screen. You can use Cydia to install <router-link to="/faq/#what-are-tweaks">tweaks</router-link>, themes and more.

## Migrating to pangu7

::: warning

While this section is optional, if you are intending on using **AppSync Unified**, or run into strange issues with Lyncis, it is highly recommended to follow this section.
