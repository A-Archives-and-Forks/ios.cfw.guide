palera1n is a work-in-progress jailbreak that patches the kernel so you can use Sileo and install tweaks. Currently, palera1n is compatible with A11 (iPhone X) and earlier devices on iOS 15.0 to 16.3.1, with some major caveats.

On A11 devices, you **must disable your passcode** and will not be able to use your passcode, or other SEP functionality, until you boot into a stock iOS state. SEP functionality includes things such as a passcode, Face ID/Touch ID, and Apple Pay. 

Additionally, if your device is an A11 device on iOS 16 and you've set a passcode before, you will need to **erase all content and settings** in order to be able to jailbreak.

## Downloads

### Installing palera1n

1. Open a terminal window and `cd` to the directory that palera1n was downloaded to.
1. Run `sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin`
    - If you get a message saying `mkdir: /usr/local/bin: File exists`, this is safe to ignore.
1. Run `sudo mv ./palera1n-macos-universal /usr/local/bin/palera1n`
    - Replace `./palera1n-macos-universal` with whatever version you downloaded
1. Run `sudo xattr -c /usr/local/bin/palera1n`
1. Run `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/palera1n`

### Running palera1n

::: warning

If you are using a USB-C to Lightning cable to do this process, you may run into issues entering into DFU mode

If you do have issues, get a USB-A to Lightning cable and, if necessary, also get a USB-C to USB-A adapter.

:::

::: tip

If you're using an Apple Silicon Mac and using a USB-C port to plug your cable/adapter into, you'll need to unplug and replug the device after `Checkmate!` appears in the logs.

:::

1. Run `palera1n`
    - Make sure your device is plugged in when entering this command
1. When ready, press `Enter` and follow the on screen instructions to enter <router-link to="/faq/#what-is-dfu-mode">DFU mode</router-link>.

::: tip

A9(X) and earlier devices have an issue where they will get stuck midway through this process in pongoOS. To work around this issue, you'll need to do the following:

1. In the terminal window, press `Control` + `C` on your keyboard
1. Rerun the command that you just ran

You'll need to do this every time you rejailbreak your device as well.
