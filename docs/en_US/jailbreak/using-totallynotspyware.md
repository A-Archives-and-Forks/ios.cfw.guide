TotallyNotSpyware and its variants are capable of jailbreaking every 64-bit iOS device on firmware versions 10.0 to 10.3.3.

Note that the TotallyNotSpyware jailbreak is not “persistent” (meaning it does not remain installed after a reboot). You will need to re-run the exploit after every reboot. You will be instructed on how to do this.

The method that needs to be followed in order to jailbreak depends on your device, select the tab that fits your device and follow the subsequent steps.

::::: tabs

:::: tab name="tns-sockport (A7 to A9(X) devices)" :default="true"

## Running tns-sockport

1. Open Safari on your iOS device
1. Go to the [https://lukezgd.github.io/tns-sockport](https://lukezgd.github.io/tns-sockport) website
1. Slide, left to right, on the `Slide for Spyware` slider
1. Once you see the `Spyware announcement` prompt, press `noot noot`
   - If the device reboots without prompting this, try again.

tns-sockport will now jailbreak your device. 

To rejailbreak in the future, repeat these steps

::: tip

Tap `Share` -> `Add to home screen` for easier access to tns-sockport.
