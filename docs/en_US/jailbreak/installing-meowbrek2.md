meowbrek2 is a <router-link to="/types-of-jailbreak/#semi-untethered-jailbreaks">semi-untethered</router-link> jailbreak, meaning it requires an app to re-apply the exploit after a reboot.

While this tool is capable of jailbreaking A11 and earlier devices on iOS/iPadOS versions 15.0 to 15.8, this tool requires the use of TrollStore, which is currently not installable without a previously existing jailbreak on 15.7.2 to 15.8.

::: warning

if you are currently using *rootful* palera1n, or setup *rootless* palera1n **before April 27th, 2023**, you need to first <router-link to="/removing-palera1n">Remove rootful palera1n</router-link> before proceeding.

If you are using *rootless* palera1n, and set it up **after April 27th, 2023**, this is not an issue, and you can continue with these steps.

:::

::: warning

If you are on 15.0 to 15.7.1, it is highly recommended to follow <router-link to="/installing-meowbrek2-trollstore">Installing meowbrek2 (TrollStore)</router-link> instead.
