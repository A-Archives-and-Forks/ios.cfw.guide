## Required Reading

In many circumstances, updating to a newer version of iOS/iPadOS can make it harder to potentially jailbreak in the future.

Luckily, iOS/iPadOS 17.0 is still signed, meaning you can restore to it from any other iOS version with the help of iTunes or Finder.

Make sure you disable `Find My` or you'll need to enter Recovery or DFU before restoring your device.
