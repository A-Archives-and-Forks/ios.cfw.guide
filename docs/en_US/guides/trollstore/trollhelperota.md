::: warning

iOS 14.0 to 14.8.1 support requires an A12 or newer device.

:::

## Installing TrollHelper

1. Open Safari
1. Depending on your iOS version, enter one of the following url's:
    - If you're on iOS 15.0 to 15.5b4 or 15.6b1 go 15.6b5, enter [https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll](https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll)
    - If you're on iOS 14.0 to 14.8.1, enter [https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll64e](https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll64e)
1. Tap `Install`

An app named `GTA Car Tracker` will now install to your iOS device, though this is really just the TrollInstaller 2 app.

## Installing TrollStore

1. Open the `GTA Car Tracker` app on your home screen
1. Press `Install TrollStore`
    - If your device reboots, redo these steps

TrollStore should now be installed. If it doesn't appear on the home screen, restart your device. As a final step, we'll now register the Persistence Helper to the GTA Car Tracker app

## Installing Persistence Helper

1. Reopen the `GTA Car Tracker` app on your home screen
1. Press `Register Persistence Helper`
