::: tip

If you are jailbroken on iOS 14.0 to 14.8.1, follow <router-link to="/installing-trollhelper">Installing TrollStore (TrollHelper)</router-link>

If you have an A10(X) or A11 device on iOS 15.0 to 15.1.1, follow <router-link to="/installing-trollinstaller">Installing TrollStore (TrollInstaller)</router-link>

If you have an A8(X)/A9(X) device on iOS 15.0 to 15.1.1, as well as an A11 or earlier device on 15.2 to 15.5b4, follow <router-link to="/installing-trollstore-sshrd">Installing TrollStore (sshrd)</router-link>

If you have an A12 or newer device on iOS 15.0 to 15.5b4, follow <router-link to="/installing-trollinstaller2">Installing TrollStore (TrollInstaller 2)</router-link>

::: tip

If your device is not in any of the aforementioned groups, but *is* on iOS 14.0 to 15.5b4, it should eventually be supported by TrollStore in some way.

If, however, your device is on iOS 13.7 and older or is running iOS 15.5 or newer, it will never be supported by TrollStore.
