::: warning

This method requires an A12 or newer device on iOS 15.0 to 15.5b4

:::

## Installing TrollInstaller

1. Open Safari
1. Go to [https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll](https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll)
1. Tap `Install`

An app named `GTA Car Tracker` will now install to your iOS device, though this is really just the TrollInstaller 2 app.

## Installing TrollStore

1. Open the `GTA Car Tracker` app on your home screen
1. Press `Install TrollStore`
    - If your device reboots, redo these steps

TrollStore should now be installed. If it doesn't appear on the home screen, restart your device.

::: tip

While TrollStore is now installed, we recommend doing the following section so that you'll be able to resolve your apps being unable to open if the icon cache is reloaded

:::

## Installing Persistence Helper

::: warning

This will replace the `Tips` app (or another app that you choose) on your device with TrollHelper

:::

1. Open the `TrollStore` app on your home screen
1. Press on the `Settings` tab and press `Install Persistence Helper`
1. Select the `Tips` app
    - You can choose another *uninstallable default app* instead, but we recommend the tips app as it's the most useless app present.

The app which was replaced should now open the Persistence Helper.
