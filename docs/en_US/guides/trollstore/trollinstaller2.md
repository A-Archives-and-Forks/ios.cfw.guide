::: warning

iOS 14.0 to 14.8.1 support requires an A12 or newer device.

:::

## Installing TrollInstaller

1. Open Safari
1. Depending on your iOS version, enter one of the following url's:
    - If you're on iOS 15.0 to 15.5b4 or 15.6b1 go 15.6b5, enter [https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll](https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll)
    - If you're on iOS 14.0 to 14.8.1, enter [https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll64e](https://api.jailbreaks.app/troll64e)
1. Tap `Install`

An app named `GTA Car Tracker` will now install to your iOS device, though this is really just the TrollInstaller 2 app.

## Installing TrollStore

1. Open the `GTA Car Tracker` app on your home screen
1. Press `Install TrollStore`
    - If your device reboots, redo these steps

TrollStore should now be installed. If it doesn't appear on the home screen, restart your device.

::: tip

While TrollStore is now installed, we recommend doing the following section so that you'll be able to resolve your apps being unable to open if the icon cache is reloaded

:::

## Installing Persistence Helper

::: warning

This will replace the `Tips` app (or another app that you choose) on your device with TrollHelper

:::

1. Open the `TrollStore` app on your home screen
1. Press on the `Settings` tab and press `Install Persistence Helper`
1. Select the `Tips` app
    - You can choose another *uninstallable default app* instead, but we recommend the tips app as it's the most useless app present.

The app which was replaced should now open the Persistence Helper.
